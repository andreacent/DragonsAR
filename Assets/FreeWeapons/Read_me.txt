Thank you for downloading our assets, this is a free pack of weapons but if you like this art-style and you are interested in getting more then checkout our Unity Asset Store Account and consider buying some of our paid assets.

Our assets are optimized for mobile and web platforms and should be good enough to use in first person view.
We also try to keep them as versatile as possible, that's why every asset has a separate texture so you can pick which ones to use if you decide not to use all of them. 
All meshes are kept untriangulated and exported with smoothing groups if you choose to edit them in 3ds max.

We hope you enjoy our creations and if you have any questions or issues please contact us at mastahcez@gmail.com and we will try to resolve them as soon as possible. We're also open for cooperation and suggestions so if you want a specific asset in this style then let us know, perhaps we're already working on it:)
